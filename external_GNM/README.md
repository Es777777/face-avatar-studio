# GNM: Generative aNthropometric Model and Ecosystem

![GNM Teaser Image](assets/readme/gnm_logo.png)

Welcome to the **GNM Ecosystem** repository. GNM - pronounced as genome
(/ˈdʒiː.noʊm/) in reference to the human genome - strives to be the most
accurate and complete 3D parametric human model.

3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) are widely used across computer vision, computer
graphics, and generative AI for representing human geometry and appearance. GNM
introduces a state-of-the-art family of parametric statistical human models and
its associated perception stack.

Our roadmap includes releasing a comprehensive suite of statistical models
complemented by perception and analysis technology. To facilitate early
community research and open development, we are beginning our open-source
release with **GNM Head**, our high-fidelity statistical 3D model of the human
head.

The ecosystem is released under the Apache 2.0 permissive license suitable for
both non-commercial and commercial applications.

## GNM Ecosystem Packages

Here we list all the available GNM packages:

| Package | Description | Status | Teaser |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **[GNM Head](gnm/shape/README.md)**  | Parametric 3D statistical human head and face geometry model providing fine-grained, disentangled control over identity, expressions, and head pose. The model contains controllable internal anatomy including eyeballs, teeth and tongue. Includes multi-framework backend support for **NumPy**, **JAX**, **PyTorch**, and **TensorFlow**, along with semantic parameter sampling. <br><br>*Technical report*: [GNM Head: A Generative aNthropometric Model of the human head](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.23687) | [![CI Linux](https://github.com/google/gnm/actions/workflows/ci-shape-linux.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/google/gnm/actions/workflows/ci-shape-linux.yml)<br>[![CI macOS](https://github.com/google/gnm/actions/workflows/ci-shape-macos.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/google/gnm/actions/workflows/ci-shape-macos.yml)<br>[![CI Windows](https://github.com/google/gnm/actions/workflows/ci-shape-windows.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/google/gnm/actions/workflows/ci-shape-windows.yml)<br>[![Lint](https://github.com/google/gnm/actions/workflows/lint.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/google/gnm/actions/workflows/lint.yml) | ![GNM Head Teaser](gnm/shape/assets/readme/teaser_heads_cropped.gif) ![GNM Head demo teaser](gnm/shape/assets/readme/gnm_head_demo.gif)
